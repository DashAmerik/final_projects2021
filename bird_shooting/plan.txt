-BIRD SHOOTING GAME PLAN-
*if finished then might make levels aka easy = trajectory / medium = no trajectory / hard = no trajectory + birds fly back


import photo of shooter, bird, bullet and clouds
put in background and moving clouds
position of shooter, spawn point of birds

birds spawn at random time intervals which can be shortened to up the difficulty
direction birds fly in / speed / if and when they turn around to fly back

point cannon up/down using w/s or up/down keys
shoot with spacebar

add gravity to flying bullets
how long you hold the space bar regulates the strength of the bullet
trajectory of shooting bullet
when bird shot change to dead sprite and have it fall with gravity

add sound effects to bullets flying out of gun, to bullets hitting bird (and it dying) and flapping/chirping sound effects if there is a bird on screen
regulate volume so that flaps/chirps of birds is quieter and more background noise

success of player is measured by how many birds were killed / total number of birds.
